<h3 id="q19">Q19</h3>

<p>A certain programming language uses 4-bit binary sequences to represent nonnegative integers. For example, the binary sequence 0101 represents the corresponding decimal value 5. Using this programming language, a programmer attempts to add the decimal values 14 and 15 and assign the sum to the variable total. Which of the following best describes the result of this operation?</p>

<p>For this question I put that “An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent either of the values 14 or 15.” However, I now know this was wrong as 14 and 15 can be represented in a 4 bit as 1110 and 1111. So, the correct answer would be “An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent 29, the sum of 14 and 15.” This is because the total, 29, is too big to be in a 4 bit.</p>

<h3 id="q36">Q36</h3>

<p>Consider the following code segment, which is intended to store ten consecutive even integers, beginning with 2, in the list evenList. Assume that evenList is initially empty.</p>

<p>i ← 1</p>

<p>REPEAT 10 TIMES</p>

<p>{
&lt; MISSING CODE &gt;
}</p>

<p>Which of the following can be used to replace &lt; MISSING CODE &gt; so that the code segment works as intended?</p>

<p>I got this question wrong as I put 
i  ←  i + 1
APPEND(evenList, 2 * i)</p>

<p>This answer is wrong because the segment is not initialized to 0, which starts it at number 4. Therefore, below is the correct answer.</p>

<p>APPEND(evenList, 2 * i)
i  ←  i + 1</p>

<h3 id="q38">Q38</h3>

<p>Three words are stored in the variables word1, word2, and word3. The values of the variables are to be updated as shown in the following table.
…
Which of the following code segments can be used to update the values of the variables as shown in the table?</p>

<p>I chose answer b (temp  ←  word1 / word1  ←  word3 / word3  ←  temp), which was incorrect because the words were assigned to the wrong “word.” Answer b (temp  ←  word1 / word1  ←  word3 / word3  ←  temp), would be correct because word1 would become zebra, word2 would stay the same, and word3 would become xylophone.</p>
