<h3 id="cost-of-free">Cost of Free</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Use of GPL software can void rights to charge for software and patents</li>
  <li>Open Source says any derivative work is free an code should be shared</li>
  <li>Qualcomm wants all derivative work to require a royalty payment payment
    <ul>
      <li>Anyone who uses the idea/patent pays royalty</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="license-communities-license-types">License Communities, License Types</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Adding and selecting a license GitHub instructions. An author, a licensor, needs to determine a license. This may result in asking…
    <ul>
      <li>Do I want to waive default copyright in reuse?</li>
      <li>Do I want to allow derivative works or not?</li>
      <li>Do I want to require all derivative code to be shared?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Open source - Free, but you cannot sell it
    - Community 
    - Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication (waives copyright)
    - Open Source MIT (allows for using code freely, and making and distributing closed source versions)(GitHub proj could be priv)</p>

<p>Close source - have to pay
    - Capitalism</p>

<h2 id="55-blog-post-reflection">5.5 Blog Post Reflection</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog.
Open source MIT</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.
Open sourced licenses are more focused on community, while closed sources are focuses on making sales.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>We have chosen the MIT Open Source</li>
</ul>

<p>Terms and Conditions
    - Digital Rights distribution
    - EX: Apps, Music,</p>

<p><strong><em>Multi-factor authentication</em></strong> 
often requires you to enter a code that has been texted or emailed to you. Other types of authentication are biometrics (finger print or facial recognition).</p>

<p><strong><em>Malware</em></strong> 
is often sent in attachments to things in email. Often they request you to click on an attachment and it starts the process of adding a virus to your computer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Phishing</em></strong> 
is where unknown sources try to entice you into a response, like click here and receive $500. Often such systems impersonate someone like Amazon asking for login information. Be careful to look closely at source of email (ie amzn.com vs amazon.com).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A Virus or Malware compromise security, they are opposite of increasing security.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Phishing is a way to get a Virus on your machine, or a way to get you to input PII.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a Virus or being compromised by Phishing it is advised to review all of you PII vulnerabilities.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2FA - Two-factor Authentication</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="blog-post-reflection">Blog Post Reflection:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.</li>
</ol>

<p>One example of PII I have seen in a CompSci Project was asking for the name, email and age. The name and email were visible to everyone.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?</li>
</ol>

<p>I think that one has to be really careful with the PII one shares online. I try not to share my last name on social media or my exact age as it is something that can be potentially dangerous.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good passwords are unpredictable, bad passwords have known PII in them, such as names.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
