<h3 id="question-corrections">QUESTION CORRECTIONS</h3>

<h4 id="q10">Q10</h4>
<p><img src="/lyds.github.io/images/Q10.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In Q10 I selected (num&gt;15) AND (num=15). However, looking back, I now realize that it must be OR because the boolean expression represents a less than or equal to sign.</p>

<h4 id="q17">Q17</h4>
<p><img src="/lyds.github.io/images/Q17.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In question 17, I made a mistake choosing B. This was wrong because the code segment needed to be a nested if statement, not two separate ones. The correct answer was D.</p>

<h4 id="q27">Q27</h4>
<p><img src="/lyds.github.io/images/Q27.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In question 27, I needed to take a closer look at the code segments to make sure it moved the robot in the correct way. I noticed I had trouble with the robot questions, so this is something to come back to. The correct answer was D.</p>

<h4 id="q43-limitations-of-simulations">Q43 Limitations of Simulations</h4>
<p><img src="/lyds.github.io/images/Q43.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I made a careless mistake on this one, accidentally clicking the wrong answer. I did the simulation lesson, so I understand simulations often make simple assumptions, and do not take into account other real-life factors.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<p>Based on the answers I got wrong, I noticed I must reflect on booleans and their code segments as it was something I often got wrong (Q10 and 17). Furthermore, I struggled with the robot questions and matching the code segments to the paths. These are things I must study and work on before the AP exam.</p>
