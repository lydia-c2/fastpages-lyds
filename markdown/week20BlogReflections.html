  <li>Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing</li>
</ol>

<p>Computing can be beneficial due to its role in community/ society. Computing allows for ways to communicate between people and build sites that promote communication, like social media. However, the drawback to computing is that it can also create harmful platforms and inventions that people can use for malicious intent. For example, computing can be used to hack and steal people’s data and information.</p>

  <li>Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
One can empower themselves in a digital world by building a community with positivity both online and in person.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
Someone who is empowered can share how they became empowered to someone who is not, building a positive, strong community. This can be done and DNHS through helping others and sharing what we have learned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Paper could be blocking digital empowerment as we are living in a digital world. By sticking to paper methods, we may fall behind on understanding how our world is mostly run today. If we fall behind on this, we will not be able to compete or keep up with the advancements that are rapidly being made in our generation and beyond.</p>
