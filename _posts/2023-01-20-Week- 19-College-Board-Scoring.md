#### Row 1
College board and I both got the same score, giving them a point for meeting all the criteria.

#### Row 2

I thought this person met the requirements for identifying the name of the variable representing the list being used in the response, as well as having who program code segments. However, after looking at the college board grade, I realized that they did not provide a segment of code accessing the data in the list.

#### Row 3

Row three met most of the requirements, however they did not explain how the list manages complexity in the program. So, they did not get the point.

#### Row 4

Both college board and I agreed that this did not meet requirements as, like CB said, "The response does not describe how this procedure contributes to the overall functionality."

#### Row 5

College board and I both got the same score, giving them a point for meeting all the criteria.

#### Row 6 

Row six did meet the three criteria, earning the point.

### Reflection:
Based on this, I believe I have somewhat gotten a good understanding of the college board grading process. I have noticed that explaining purpose instead of functionality is something I must really make sure I understand before my project as it is a requirement that many people miss. I can refer to this example to help me understand how to meet the requirements as well.

#### Row 1

The program shows input, functionality, and output. Plus, they explain the overall purpose well, earning the point.

#### Row 2

College board and I both got the same score, giving them a point for meeting all the criteria.

#### Row 3

College board and I both got the same score, giving them a point for meeting all the criteria. They explained how the list managed complexity.

#### Row 4

College board and I both got the same score, giving them a point for meeting all the criteria. The written portion describes what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program.

#### Row 5

College board and I both got the same score, giving them a point for meeting all the criteria.


#### Row 6

College board and I both got the same score, giving them a point for meeting all the criteria. They describe the two calls, the conditions tested, and the result of each call.

### Reflection:
Based on this, I believe I have somewhat gotten a good understanding of the college board grading process. I can refer to this example to help me understand how to fully meet the requirements as well.

#### Row 1

College board and I both got the same score, giving them a point for meeting all the criteria.

#### Row 2

College board and I both got the same score, giving them 0 points.

#### Row 3

I gave them a point for this row, however college board did not becaus they didn't explain how the code could be written without a list.

#### Row 4

College board and I both got the same score, giving them 0 points for meeting none of the criteria. 

#### Row 5

College board and I both got the same score, giving them 0 points for meeting none of the criteria. 


#### Row 6

College board and I both got the same score, giving them 0 points for meeting none of the criteria. 


### Reflection:
Based on this, I believe I have somewhat gotten a good understanding of the college board grading process. I noticed I gave this person a point when they didn't explain how the could could be written without the list, which is something I must look out for when I am writing my written response. I can refer to this example to help me understand what not to do in order to meet the requirements as well.

#### Row 1

The student met all the criteria for row 1, explaining program purpose as well as the functionality and the input and output. 


#### Row 2

College Board and I both gave them a point for meeting the criteria.

#### Row 3

College Board and I both gave them a point for meeting the criteria.

#### Row 4

Both college board and I gave them a point because the procedure was thoroughly explained with an explicit parameter. Furthermore, they explained the functionality of the procedure and showed where the procedure is called.

#### Row 5

College Board and I both gave them a point for meeting both criteria.

#### Row 6

College Board and I both did not give this student a point because they did not meet any of the required criteria for this row.

### Reflection:
Based on this, I believe I have somewhat gotten a good understanding of the college board grading process. I also learned to make sure I meet all the criteria for the 6th row as I must make sure my written response has descriptions of the required arguments, conditions, and results. However, I can refer to this example to help me understand how to meet the requirements as well.
