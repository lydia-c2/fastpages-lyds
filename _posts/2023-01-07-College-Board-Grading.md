## [College Board's Grade](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1heOeGcmxqTjG4Hqf0Vi1YFUZt_Trs_CE/view)



### REFLECTION:

#### Row 1
- College Board graded row 1 as a 0 due to the written response missing the "overall purpose of the program" as stated in the rubric. 
- However, I disagreed with this and rated section 1 a 1 as I believed the explained the purpose of the program was to "provide information on a triangle based on inputted side lengths"


Seeing as this explanation did not meet the college board expectations, it allowed me to realize that I must be extra thorough and detailed about the actual purpose of the program and not just its function. 

- For Row 3, both college board and I agreed that this did not meet the expectations on the rubric. The written response did not show a list being used to manage complexity. Therefore, they did not get a point.
