Similarities in mission statements= tech for good of the people, use tech to help people
Loves high tech because she loves the impact (global/macro effect) in producing products for people in the world

Qualcomm: “Inventing tech the world loves”

Thermo Fisher Scientific: “Enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer”


# Kris Porter: Software engineer (SRE, DevOps, Infrastructure) <- not writing code all day
-  UCLA for Elecrtrical Engineering
- Failed first computer science (stay motivated and don’t have to know where in tech degree you want)
- Masters degree in electrical engineering from cal state LA 

- Got job at start up GPM (email marketing automation which was like DevOps)
- Worked at NBC Universal (streaming media infrastructure)

Data structures/algorithms/Python/etc very important and used a lot
rest API slowly moving to Graph QL at Twitter
Data scientists = analyze customer demand/use (also non-technical role)




 
Learning the Linux operating system is a marketing skill
He started doing Dev Ops stuff, meaning he deployed his software


Focused on Communication Systems and Computer Networks
(Cs 31) Failed…
- POV if you feel like you’re bad a comp sci = KEEP SLAYING

- Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Cal State LA
- Researched networked sensors (robot swings between trees and scans/takes data on environment) < deployed in Costa Rica jungle
    ^Learned about Linux here
- Was introduced to Qualcolmm in 2014 (Mr. Mort. hired him :0)
- Worked for Twitter (#workedforElonsince2021)
    - Twitter timeline = API that goes to twitter database and retrieves info from many users) 
    - Twitter trains new employees for three weeks
    ^ Twitter used to use all rest APIS but now moving to GraphQL

- He continues to learn (doesn’t get bored in industry)
    - ^ you don’t have to follow one path, you can learn in many different areas

Center for Embedded Networked Centers
Networked Info Mechanical Systems (NIMS)

## Questions:


#### How is Agile Methodology Used in Real Life Companies?
- Planned in a group with other engineers to coordinate in Agile Methodology 
- Short sprints
- The concept of agile is important because they did projects in a span of 6-12 months



- When you see a company shuffle = look for new jobs DON’T WAIT
Qualcomm uses GitLab = repositories cost money = analyzed download levels to predict when to archive/delete repositories
Kathyleen uses databases and data science to predict sales, weather (wine harvest), etc. Non-technical roles = recommending clients to buy certain things/do things


Most Important skill to have in the tech industry?
#### KRIS:
Continuous Learning
Learn multiple programming languages
“Learn how to learn” = always be ready to learn more



Don’t be super concerned about things you read on the news (resiliance)
The only risk is not learning
 
#### KATHY:
- Be adaptive
- Career paths won’t always be a straight line
- Best technicians: listen and solve technical requirements (can explain in non-technical terms)
- Something they had to Learn:
- To be adaptive 
- Be able to pass code tests (code has to work)

#### Work/life balance:
- Some companies are great with work hours 
- Some have a lot of hours/deadlines
- If you have outside hobbies/necessities = set boundaries

Coding = critical thinking
- Allows for problem solving
- Dissecting issues or building solutions


#### Most important qualities in tech industry: 
- continuous learning (learning how to learn)
- resilience (don’t fear stuff in the news)
    - go for it (even if in job for short period of time = still learning and gaining skills)
- good listener (in normal terms) and then translate into tech
