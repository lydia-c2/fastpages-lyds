## Arcade

This is a picture of the arcade site I saw when I walked around the Night at the Museum. The site was able to show me different games you could play. I visited and learned about many projects (not all pictured) and it was so cool to see all the different ideas. I also saw a site, called ETrack, which was an exercise tracking site (pictured below).

## Ceramics

Finally, I went to visit many of the Art classes like AP Studio Art, Digital Design (I think it's called smthing else), and Ceramics. It was really cool to see all the ceramics artwork. Plus, in studio art, we learned about the prompt behind their art pieces which was really cool. 
 
## Next Steps

Next time, I think I want to present to more people about our own project and let people interact with what we've built. Plus,  would like to see more projects from other students.
