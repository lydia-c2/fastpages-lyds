### QUESTION CORRECTIONS

#### Q10
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q10.png)

In Q10 I selected (num>15) AND (num=15). However, looking back, I now realize that it must be OR because the boolean expression represents a less than or equal to sign.


#### Q17
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q17.png)

In question 17, I made a mistake choosing B. This was wrong because the code segment needed to be a nested if statement, not two separate ones. The correct answer was D.

#### Q27
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q27.png)

In question 27, I needed to take a closer look at the code segments to make sure it moved the robot in the correct way. I noticed I had trouble with the robot questions, so this is something to come back to. The correct answer was D.

#### Q43 Limitations of Simulations

I made a careless mistake on this one, accidentally clicking the wrong answer. I did the simulation lesson, so I understand simulations often make simple assumptions, and do not take into account other real-life factors.

## Reflection

Based on the answers I got wrong, I noticed I must reflect on booleans and their code segments as it was something I often got wrong (Q10 and 17). Furthermore, I struggled with the robot questions and matching the code segments to the paths. These are things I must study and work on before the AP exam.
