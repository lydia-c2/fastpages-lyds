### Question 12

I got this question wrong because I thought that it was asking which one would indicate a phishing attack, rather than which one was least likely. Option A would be the correct answer because an email from your bank to confirm a transaction would be safer.

### Question 31

I got this one wrong because I did not thoroughly read through the algorithm and the gate would open outside of business hours. Option D is correct because the gate would not open outside of business hours and the gate would open correctly.

### Question 40

I got this one wrong because interchanging the rotate_right and rotate_left blocks would push the robot off the grid. There would be no change needed in this algorithm.

### Question 41

I got this question wrong because the list has to be sorted in order of value in order to use a binary search algorithm. So, converting binary to decimal numbers is not necessary.
