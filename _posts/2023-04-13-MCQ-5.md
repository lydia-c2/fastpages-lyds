![Results]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ5Results.png)

- I got a 64/66 on this quiz


![Q14]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2018Q14.png)

- I got this question wrong because I thought that the 2 procedures would return the same values. However, answer C is the correct answer because they display the same **number** of values, but not the same ones.


![Q48]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2018Q48.png)

- I got this question wrong because I just misread the procedure/code they gave.



#### Reflection

Overall, I did well on ths quiz and was able to figure out many of the questions, However, I do need to make sure I read through procedure questions thoroughly.
