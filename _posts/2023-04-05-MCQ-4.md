# MCQ 4 

![Results]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ4Results.png)
- I got a 47/50

![Q18]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q18.png)

- I got this question wrong because knowing when a operation will be available is difficult to predict. The correct answer is C.

![Q37]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q37.png)

- I got this question wrong because the algorithm would run in a reasonable amount of time. The correct answer is B.

![Q39]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q39.png)

- 1111 is a possible output as 1 is an option each time. The correct answer is D because 3 cannot be displayed before 2.

## Reflection:

Overall, I noticed I struggles with the drawing problems as I had to search them up. Plus, I still need to study the binary to fully understand it and be able to answer MCQ about it. However, data questions were easier for me, I just need to make sure I read each option thoroughly.
