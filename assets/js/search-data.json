Daily Video 1 . Learning Objectives: . Develop a program using a development process. | Design a program and its user interface. #### Essential Knowledge | A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature. | There ar emultiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: investigation and reglecting | designing | prototyping | testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process. | A development process that is incrememntal is one that breaks the problem in to smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole. | The design of a program incoroporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraits, as well as the concerns and interests of the people hwo will use the program. | Some ways investigation can be [erformed are as follows: collecting data through surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide. | A program&#39;s specification defines the requirements for the program. | In a development process, the dsign phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification. | The design phase of a program may include: brainstorming | planning and storyboarding | organizing the program into modules and funtional components | creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface | development of a testing strategy for the program #### How is a program developed? It starts with an idea. | . | Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind. | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan. | Sometimes the development is more exploratory tahn anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad). Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants. #### How is a program developed? Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect. | . | Investigation is an important step in the process. | Developers must: determine the requirements of the program | understand the constraints | understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? surverys | user testing | interviews | direct observations After initial investigation and reflection, | . | Developers design the program by brainstorming (draw on ingestigation) | storyboarding the program | planning user experience | laying out the user interface | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that describe how a program should behave | include a list of user interactions | . | The programs specifications outline all of the requirements. | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): an incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program Testing, testing, and more testing! | . | Developers test the program every step of the way. | Testing occurs at the micro level | macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection. ## Daily Video 2 #### Learning Objectives | Acknowledge code segments used from other sources. #### Essential Knowledge | It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source. | Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the origin or original author&#39;s name. #### How is aprogram developed? Program development is rarely a solo endeavor. | Programs are usually developed by teams of peoplle. | Individuals/teams work on different functional components. | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work. | Their names must e written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project. While documentation is an important place to give credit: | Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit. | This is an important part of the development of the program. | When developers find a bug (or an error in a program), they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem. | This may be most useful after program is completed, and users find additional bugs. Many times developers use code segments, procedures, alogrithms, and and more that are written by others. | These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited. | This is similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article. | Any code segments, procedures, algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author. | The program documentation should influde the author&#39;s name and the source of any code segments being used. | This portion of the documentaion may resemble a bibliography or a works cited page in a research paper. ## Daily Video 3 #### Lesson Objectives | Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation. #### Essential Knowledge | Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed. | Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs. | Programmers should document a program throughout its development. | Program documentation helps in developing and maintaininig correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. | Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be rquired. #### How is a program developed? Programmers create something called program documentation in order to: | describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe: functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program #### When does documentation happen? Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: | At the beginning: list of specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throught can improve: | efficiency of overall programming process | programmers&#39; ability to test and refine the program | programmers&#39; response to bugs #### How do programmers document while programming? Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. | Commenting allows programmers to write text within the program. | This text does not affect the program. | Comments are for programmers to read. | This is a form of ocumentation and can be very useful when programmers collaborate or work individually. | .",

Lightly Review Videos and take notes on topics with Blog | Complete assigned MCQ questions | . Here are some code segments you can practice fixing: . alphabet = &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot; alphabetList = [] for i in alphabet: alphabetList.append(i) print(alphabetList) . The intended outcome is to determine where the letter is in the alphabet using a while loop . What is a good test case to check the current outcome? Why? | Make changes to get the intended outcome. | . letter = input(&quot;What letter would you like to check?&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; 26: if alphabetList[i] == letter: print(&quot;The letter &quot; + letter + &quot; is the &quot; + str(i) + &quot; letter in the alphabet&quot;) i += 1 .

This code outputs the even numbers from 0 - 10 using a while loop. . Analyze this code to determine what can be changed to get the outcome to be odd numbers. (Code block below) | . evens = [] i = 0 while i &lt;= 10: evens.append(i) i += 2 print(evens) . This code should output the odd numbers from 0 - 10 using a while loop. . odds = [] i = 0 while i &lt;= 10: odds.append(i) i += 2 print(odds) . This code outputs the even numbers from 0 - 10 using a for loop. . Analyze this code to determine what can be changed to get the outcome to be odd numbers. (Code block below) | . numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] evens = [] for i in numbers: if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0): evens.append(numbers[i]) print(evens) . This code should output the odd numbers from 0 - 10 using a for loop. . numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] odds = [] for i in numbers: if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0): odds.append(numbers[i]) print(odds) .

Why? | Make changes to get the intended outcome. | . numbers = [] newNumbers = [] i = 0 while i &lt; 100: numbers.append(i) i += 1 for i in numbers: if numbers[i] % 5 == 0: newNumbers.append(numbers[i]) if numbers[i] % 2 == 0: newNumbers.append(numbers[i]) print(newNumbers) . Challenge . This code segment is at a very early stage of implementation. . What are some ways to (user) error proof this code? | The code should be able to calculate the cost of the meal of the user | . Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user print(total) . Hacks . Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... . What errors may arise in your project? | What are some test cases that can be used? | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project? As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding. FYI, related tests could be in same Issue by using markdown checkboxes to separate tests. | . | .",
