Facebook seems to appeal to a more mature audience, while tiktok promotes a platform for younger people. Facebook focuses on a more community based, communication site where audiences can talk and make groups. Tiktok focuses on more entertainment, promoting creativity and videos appealing towards younger generations. . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? . In a more negative light, virtual assistants may have female voices due to the long standing gender role that women are there to serve and help. If this bias is true, then it can be harmful as it continues to support the idea that women are supposed to be obedient and serve whenever called. However, there are options to change the voices, from accents to gender. . An algorithm that influences your decisions? .

Hacks . The Big Picture purpose of this hack is to build a database. Being able to create an SQLite table and populate test data within it is the major goal. To do this effectively it is imperative to show the following. . Build Schema for a table, make a new model file and use users.py as an example. Start slow and simple and build up. | Build an initXXXXX() method and use it to add preliminary/test data to the table. Once again use users.py as an example. | Make a 30-60 second video where you show a Debugging session of making new rows in the table. Use sqlite marketplace tools and/or sqlite3 command line tool to show success in creating table and adding data. | Hack Helper . Here are some tips. . Become familiar with initUsers(). Observe it is called/activated from main.py. This function activates after you run the main.py and activate the web application in the browser. Observe that the sqlite.db file will appear in the volumes directory in conjunction with home screen of site appearing in browser. . | Delete sqlite.db from volumes directory on your development machine. Set breakpoint on initUsers() and run main.py using debug. Use the step into option on the debugger and observe the creation of data. . | . @app.before_first_request def activate_job():initJokes() initUsers() . Make your own XXXXX.py file under model directory. Follow users.py and develop your own schema from the OOP code you did in last Hacks. Follow the pattern in users.py to make a initXXXX() function top populate some test data. . | In main.py, add your initXXXX() method to def activate_job() function shown above. Use this as basis of your video debugging session. Debugging is hugely important at this level to understand your database success prior to building an API. Building initXXXX() method, adding database records, and debugging will enable you to verify CRUD operations as you develop. . | .",

This person did not meet the requirements as they explained the function, not the purpose. . Row 2 . I thought this person met the requirements for identifying the name of the variable representing the list being used in the response, as well as having who program code segments. However, after looking at the college board grade, I realized that they did not describe the data in animalList. . Row 3 . Row three met most of the requirements, however they did not explain how the list manages complexity in the program. So, they did not get the point. . Row 4 . Both college board and I agreed that this did not meet requirements as, like CB said, “The response does not describe how this procedure contributes to the overall functionality.” . Row 5 . Student did not explain how the algorithm works in enough detail that someone could recreate it. In addition, the student did not explain anything about the sequencing, selection, iteration or algorithm. . Row 6 . Row six did meet the three criteria, earning the point. . Reflection: . Based on this, I believe I have somewhat gotten a good understanding of the college board grading process. I have noticed that explaining purpose instead of functionality is something I must really make sure I understand before my project as it is a requirement that many people miss.

I gave this person a point because I thought they showed two program code segments as well as the names of variables and the description of the data. However, College board did not give them a point because the second code segment does not meet the criteria. . Row 3 . Both college board and I did not give them a point because the list is not used to manage complexity. . Row 4 . Both college board and I gave them a point because the procedure was thoroughly explained with an explicit parameter. Furthermore, they explained the functionality of the procedure and showed where the procedure is called. . Row 5 . College Board and I both gave them a point for meeting both criteria. . Row 6 . I gave them a point for describing the two calls, conditions, and results. However, college board did not give them a the point as they gave “the conditions being tested rather than two different arguments.” . Reflection: .

A software library contains procedures that can be used in the creation of new programs. | Existing segments of code can come from internal or external sources, ie. libraries or previously written code. | The use of libraries simplifies the task of creating complex programs. | Application program interfaces (APIs) are specifications for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | Documentation for a library or API is necessary in understanding the key behaviors provided by the API/library and how to utilize them in your work. | . What is a Library? . A library is a collection of code from an external source that can be used to add functionality to a program. | Libraries are very useful, as they can be used to save time and effort in the development process. | Libraries are usually included in a program using a special keyword called &quot; .&quot; This keyword tells the program to look for the library and use its code. | .

Explanation: . The first code is way more efficient than the second as it utilizes loops and ranges of numbers within conditionals to run the code faster. This way was more efficient as it took less steps to write out the program, as well as for the algorithm to run. This way was also easier to debug as the code was short and easy to read and fix mistakes. . Hacks #3 . What is Algorithm Efficiency? . Algorithm Efficiency is the number of steps required to run through an algorithm or find a solution. An efficient algorithm would have less steps to get to the end of an sequence.

College Board Essential Knowledge . A software library contains procedures that can be used in the creation of new programs. | Existing segments of code can come from internal or external sources, ie. libraries or previously written code. | The use of libraries simplifies the task of creating complex programs. | Application program interfaces (APIs) are specifications for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | Documentation for a library or API is necessary in understanding the key behaviors provided by the API/library and how to utilize them in your work. | . Defining a Library . A library is a collection of code from an external source that can be used to add functionality to a program. | Libraries are very useful, as they can be used to save time and effort in the development process. | Libraries are usually included in a program using a special keyword called &quot; .&quot; This keyword tells the program to look for the library and use its code. | . Example . import math math.sqrt(64) . 8.0 . Review Questions (Answer for candy!) . . 1) In your own words, what is a library? . 2) Why are libraries useful when writing a program? . 3) What keyword is used to add a pre-made library? . Hacks . Write a program that uses a library/libraries in any sort of manner. | Explain your work/code | . . . Lesson 3.15.1 . What is randomization? . 1) Randomization generates a value between two numbers. For example RANDOM(1,3) may result as 1 or 2 or 3, either one of those. . 2) Now if we look into our day to day life we can see that randomization is all around us. . Now for a piece of candy does anyone want to tell us an example of randomization during our day to day life. . 3) In order to use the random function we have to first import random at the very beggining. . Now lets look at the code below right here. . import random answer1 = random.randint(0,3) answer2 = random.randint(1,8) answer3 = answer1 + answer2 print(answer3) . 8 . 1) The lowest number that will be generated is 0 for answer 1 and for answer2, the lowest that will be generated is 1 so the lowest number that can be generated for answer 3 would be 1. . 2) The highest number that will be generated to answer1 is 3 and the highest number that will be generated for answer 2 is 8 so the highest number for answer 3 would be 11. . 3) The range of numbers that answer 3 could print out would be from 1 to 11. . So a normal dice contains six sides with 1-6 on the individual sides. Which of the following code would simulate the result of rolling the dice three times and adds together all the obtained values together? . A. . import random sum = random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . B. . import random sum = random.randint(1,18) print(sum) . 17 . C. . import random sum = 3*random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . 1) Its not B because B is saying that it is going to choose one number between the range of 1 and 18 and not the sum of 3 diff numbers. . 2) C is not correct also because C is saying that the computer is choosing one random between 1 and 6 and multiplying that 3 times but we want the sum of three different numbers between 1 and 6. . 3) So the answer is A. . . For the last example: . import random i = 1 while i &lt; 4: choose = random.randint(1,10) print(choose) i += 1 . 6 9 8 . Which answers could not be possible for the code above? . A. 4 7 6 . B. 9 1 8 . C. 2 11 5 . D. 5 10 2 . Random can also have different methods, in the above examples we only used one example, randint which returns a random number between the given range. Down below I have created a table of all the methods with the description of what it is used for with the random function. . Method | Description . seed() | Initialize the random number generator . getstate() | Returns the current internal state of the random number generator . setstate() | Restores the internal state of the random number generator . getrandbits() | Returns a number representing the random bits . randrange() | Returns a random number between the given range . randint() | Returns a random number between the given range . choice() | Returns a random element from the given sequence . choices() | Returns a list with a random selection from the given sequence . shuffle() | Takes a sequence and returns the sequence in a random order . sample() | Returns a given sample of a sequence . random() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 . uniform() | Returns a random float number between two given parameters . betavariate() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 based on the Beta distribution (used in statistics) . expovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Exponential distribution (used in statistics) . gammavariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Gamma distribution (used in statistics) . gauss() | Returns a random float number based on the Gaussian distribution (used in probability theories) . lognormvariate() | Returns a random float number based on a log-normal distribution (used in probability theories) . normalvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the normal distribution (used in probability theories) . vonmisesvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the von Mises distribution (used in directional statistics) . paretovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Pareto distribution (used in probability theories) . weibullvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Weibull distribution (used in statistics) . Lesson Recap: 1) random function generates a random number from a to b (range of two numbers) . 2) You need to import random in order to use the random function . 3) Every result from an import function is equally likely to occur . Hacks for lesson 3.15.1 . Write a few lines of code that implements the import function . | Define what an import random function do . | List a few other things that we can import other than random . | . . . 3.15.2 Lesson . Some Essential Knowledge that you need to know | RANDOM (a,b) will provide you with a random integer between the numbers a-b | Ex. RANDOM (7,18) can provide you with the number 13. | Using a random generator means each result can come out as different. | . Lets Try an Example Scenario . Try and formulate a way to write a segment of code that can simulate the flipping of a coin. | You have to use a random generator and assign the output of &quot;Heads&quot; or &quot;Tails&quot; to a specified result. | . import random flip = random.randint(1,2) if flip == 1: print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: print(&quot;Tails&quot;) # Try this code for yourself! . Tails . This is a pretty simple code to understand. | First we use the randomization here between the 1 and 2 to determine which side of the coin we get. | If we get 1 then we get heads. If we get 2 or anything else than 2, then we get Tails. | . Now let&#39;s answer questions using your knowledge. . If you want yes to show up 50% of the time, which of the code segments can you use? | . random(1,100) &lt;= 50 random(1,100) == 50 random(1,10) &lt;= 5 random(1,10) &gt;= 5 . The answer is A,C, and D! | . Why isn&#39;t the answer B? . This because when you are saying equal to 50, you are saying only when this one number shows up the output will be yes. | You want it to come up 50 percent of the time not just when that one number shows up. | . Hacks 3.15.2 . For your hacks you need to create a random number generator that will simulate this situation: | There is a spinner divided into eight equal parts. 3 parts of the spinner are green, two parts are blue, one part is purple, one part is red, and one part is orange.

Hexadecimals go from 0-9 and A-F | . Binary Numbers: . Unsigned Integers: Are positive numbers (and 0) that do not require a sign bit. . Signed Integer: Can contain the value 0 and positive and negative numbers. . Signed and unsigned integers are determined by the leading digit of a binary number | . Floating Point: Floating points are whole integers (positive or negative) that also have a decimal point. . EX: 2.5, 7.85, etc. | EX: NOT 10, 4, 0… | . Binary Data Abstractions: . Boolean: A Boolean is a system of algebraic notation that represents logical propositions . Booleans are also conditionals, testing whether a statement is true or false | . ASCII: Short for “American Standard Code for Information Interchange,” ASCII is the standard format for data exchange between computers. . Unicode: Like ASCII, Unicode is a standard encoding format but for international use between different scripts and languages. . RGB: Stands for Red, Green, Blue, which is the system for colors within a computer. . Each color value goes from 0-255 | . Data Compression: . Lossy: Data is permanently lost and cannot be recovered after decompression . EX: JPEG, photo compression, etc Lossless: (not discussed yet) | . . Unit 3 Algorithm/Programming Terms . Variables: .

Values or operations like strings, integers, booleans, characters, etc. . Assignment Operators: . An assignment operator is an equal sign, or a symbol, which is needed in order to store a value inside a variable. . Stores value inside variable | . Managing Complexity with Variables: . Lists: Lists are sequences of elements where every element = a variable 2D Lists: Can be defined as a matrix with two dimensions, the rows and columns . Also an array (data structure used to store elements) | An array can only store similar types of elements Dictionaries: Dictionaries are used to store data values in key Class: An outline used when creating a new product | . . Algorithms: . An algorithm is the instructions for the code to execute . Sequence: . A sequence is the order in which the algorithm will run. . Selection: . Selection is the code that will execute depending on whether or not the conditional is true or false. .

Characters are symbols or alphabetic letters | Strings are sequences of characters | Length is the number of symbols output when an procedure executes | . Concatenation: . When two strings join together . Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings: . Upper() and Lower() converts characters in strings to either uppercase or lowercase . Traversing strings is to process each part or character within a string (usually R to L) | . Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements: . If, Elif, and Else conditionals allow the procedure to check whether the conditions are true, and if so, to execute the code. Else is what code is run when none of the if or elif statements are met. . . Python For, While loops with Range, with List: . For and while loops allow for a code to repeat without having to type out the code multiple times. . While loops allow a procedure to repeat while the statement is true. | For loops using lists allow you to pull variables from within the lists or whatever has been appended into the list | . . Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue: . Break allows while loops to stop if a condition is met . If a while loop is true, it will continue until it is broken | . Procedural Abstraction, Python Def procedures: . “Def” is used to create function variables . Parameters, Return Values: . Parameters are independent variables that allow a procedure to execute without knowing specific input values at the moment.

Basics of Procedures | Calling Procedures | Determine Results of Procedures | . What is a procedure? . Essential Knowledge: . A procedure is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values. May be called &quot;method&quot; or &quot;function&quot; in different programming languages. | . | Parameters are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result. It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values. | Procedures can be classified as sequencing, selection, and iteration. How? | . Example: . What is the procedure&#39;s name? | What are the parameters? | What did the procedure return? | . x = 5 y = 3 def multiply(x, y): product = x * y return product answer = multiply(x, y) print(&quot;The product of&quot;, x, &quot;times&quot;, y, &quot;is&quot;, answer) . The product of 5 times 3 is 15 . Calling Procedures . To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure | Procedures do not require parameters, but the parentheses must be there | . Ex: . procedureName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) | How would you call this procedure? | . num = 5 def math(x): op1 = x * 2 op2 = op1 - 9 return op2 . Quiz (Part of Hacks) .

Determining the Result of a Procedure . To determine the result of a procedure or any code, you must follow the code line by line and see what each one does . | Using syntax, you can determine the result by . function parameters | return value and statements | . | . To use return values, you have to write the syntax return followed by the expression you would like to return var | . A return statement exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and to return a certain value . | Value can be string, a tuple, or any other type that is being sent back to the main program . | . Ex: . def divide(num1,num2): x = num1/num2 return x . what is x being assigned to inside the function? . | As a reminder, to use function parameters, you would have to write the syntax name of the function followed by the parameters needed in parentheses . | Function parameters are the parameters that are used when calling the function in order to get a result. . | . What are the function parameters in this procedure? . What values are being passed to the function? . def function(first_name, last_name): print(first_name + &quot; &quot; + last_name) function(&quot;Peter&quot;,&quot;Parker&quot;) function(&quot;Safin&quot;, &quot;Singh&quot;) . Peter Parker Safin Singh . In the cell above, the function is being called twice, which shows the importance of function in order to accomplish the same thing with different parameters. . What is wrong with the function? . Can you translate the binary numbers into decimal notation? . def find_cube(num): result = bin(num * num * num) return result cube = find_cube(3) cube2 = find_cube(4) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube2 ) . Cube: 0b11011 Cube: 0b1000000 . Once again, I called the function twice, which is useful, because it allows the coder to do the same thing multiple times with different arguments. . Topic 3.13 (3.B) Managing Complexity - Safin . Overview: Learning Objectives . increasing code modularity using procedures abstracting large problems into smaller ones | extract shared features to reduce code duplication | . | using parameters to reuse procedures | improving code readability with procedures | manipulating procedure logic and preserving outputEssentially, we&#39;ll learn how and when it is appropriate to construct a function (procedural abstraction) and what its benefits are . | . Vocabulary: . Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | Abstraction - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use | Duplication - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency | Logic - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code | . Parameters . As we saw above, parameters can be used to make functions work with multiple different inputs. Let&#39;s review the following code . # these parameters are the inputs to the function, and they are used # inside the function to perform some operation def add(x, y): # inside the function, we can use the x and y parameters just like # we would use any other variable result = x + y return result # to call the function and pass in values for the x and y parameters, # we simply provide the values as arguments in the function call result = add(2, 3) print(result) # should output 5 # we can also use variables as arguments in the function call x = 5 y = 10 result = add(x, y) print(result) # should output 15 # we can even use the result of one function call as an argument # in another function call result = add(add(2, 3), add(4, 5)) print(result) # should output 14 . 5 15 14 . In the above example, parameters were used to create a function that could be called multiple times without code duplication. . Modularity . In the following example, we will use specialized functions and explain their benefits: . import math def hypotenuse(leg1, leg2): # notice we&#39;re using this &lt;var&gt; * &lt;var&gt; syntax multiple times? # this has multiple drawbacks: # - it&#39;s repetitive and makes the code longer # - if we wanted to change the operator being # applied to `leg1` and `leg2`, we&#39;d have to do it twice! leg1_squared = leg1 * leg1 leg2_squared = leg2 * leg2 return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## VERSUS ## # this works, but let&#39;s try to write the &quot;squared&quot; variable assignment statements more concisely... def square(a): return a * a def hypotenuse_abstracted(leg1, leg2): # not only is this shorter, but we can now: # - better understand the code at a glance--we know exactly # what `square` should do # - change the operator in a single place (`square`) rather than # multiple times within this hypotenuse function leg1_squared = square(leg1) leg2_squared = square(leg2) return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## EXTRA CHALLENGE ## # is it possible to write the `hypotenuse` function in a single line? def hypotenuse_abstracted2(leg1, leg2): # ... pass assert hypotenuse(3, 4) == hypotenuse_abstracted(3, 4) == 5 . Abstracting Shared Features . Say we want to create a set of functions that count the number of words in a sentence that start with a certain character. We want to create... . count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(sentence) | count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(sentence) | . In order to count words starting with a certain character, we&#39;ll first need to split up the sentence into words. This behavior will be shared across both functions we intend to create, so procedural abstraction is appropriate here. . # is a separate element in the list def split_string(s): # use the split() method to split the string into a list of words words = s.split(&quot; &quot;) # initialize a new list to hold all non-empty strings new_words = [] for word in words: if word != &quot;&quot;: # add all non-empty substrings of `words` to `new_words` new_words.append(word) return words # this function takes a list of words as input and returns the number of words # that start with the given letter (case-insensitive) def count_words_starting_with_letter(words, letter): count = 0 # loop through the list of words and check if each word starts with the given letter for word in words: # use the lower() method to make the comparison case-insensitive if word.lower().startswith(letter): count += 1 return count # this function takes a string as input and returns the number of words that start with &#39;a&#39; def count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s): # use the split_string() function to split the input string into a list of words words = split_string(s) # use the count_words_starting_with_letter() function to count the number of words # that start with &#39;a&#39; in the list of words count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;a&quot;) return count # see above def count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s): words = split_string(s) count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;d&quot;) return count # example usage: s = &quot; This is a test string! Don&#39;t you think this is cool? &quot; a_count = count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s) d_count = count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s) print(&quot;Words starting with a:&quot;, a_count) print(&quot;Words starting with d:&quot;, d_count) ## ADD another function (ask for letter and then check which one) # Define x = input # count = count words starting with letter (words, x) . Words starting with a: 1 Words starting with d: 1 . In the above example, we have: . defined several functions that perform different tasks related to processing a string | abstracted away shared behavior for both functions that count the number of words starting with a specific character in a string | . Topic 3.13 (3.C) Developing Procedures - David &amp; Alex . Overview: Learning Objectives . parameters being used to manage complexity parameters storing variables | parameters storing arguments | . | calling functions with procedure names choosing procedure names | calling procedures in python and javascript | . | . Vocabulary: . Procedure - a module of code that is created to complete a certain task, this is basically a function | Procedure Name - the name that is given to a function/procedure | Parameters - a variable that is used in a function to allow for data to be imported into a function | Arguments - a way to provide information to a function, usually defined outside a function and then imported into a function with parameters | . Functions - Basic Structure . Functions can be created in many different languages. Below are some examples in Collegeboard&#39;s format, Python, and Javascript. . Collegeboard . Above, the function is defined as PROCEDURE, which tells the coder that this is a function. The function is then named with procName, which is simply how the function is identified. parameter1, parameter2,... are variables that can be predefined elsewhere and repeatedly used in the same function. This will be gone over later in the lesson so don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t get it. block of statements are just things that you would place inside a function to complete a certain task, such as print() in Python. . Python . def function(a,b): # function is defined print(a+b) # prints output of variables function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used function(2,3) # another instance . 3 5 . Python is similar to the Collegeboard example, where def defines the function, function, and then is followed by parameters a,b, which can later be interchanged with any numbers as shown with function(1,2). The numbers are called arguments, which are information provided to the function with parameters. In this case, the parameters are being added within the function and then printed. . Javascript . function Function(a,b) { return a + b; } Function(1,2) Function(2,3) . 3 5 . Javascript in this case is almost the exact same as Python, the only differences being that function is called with function and that the formatting is a little different. Otherwise, it does the exact same thing as the Python example. . Example . function div(a,b) { return (a+b)/2 } div(3,7) . What is the procedure name? | What are the parameters? | What operation is being done? | what would the output of this code be? | . Parameters . In functions, there are sometimes parameters that the functions have in which you can call to the function giving arguements that will provide input to the function For example: | . def function(num1, num2): if num1 &gt; num2: print(&quot;num1 is greater than num2&quot;) elif num1 &lt;num2: print(&quot;num1 is less than num 2&quot;) num1= 6 num2 = 8 function(num1,num2) . num1 is less than num 2 . In this function, it takes in two parameters num1 and num2 | Whithin this function it uses conditionals to determine if num 1 is larger or smaller than num2 | When calling to this function we must put in two arguements, num1 and num2 respectively | We put in 6 for num1 and 8 for num2 and the algorithm runs and gives us an outcome | . This basic function in python can be recreated in Javasript . function compare(a,b) { if(a&gt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is greater than b&quot;) } else if (a&lt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is less than b&quot;) } } // How do you call to this function? . what are the parameters? | What is the output? | what are the arguements? | . Calling functions . When calling functions, you have to ask yourself some questions Does the function have any parameters? | does the parameter have output? | . | Depending on these answers, the way you will call to a function will be different | . Example where it does does have parameters and gives output . def InchestoFeet(inches): Feet = 0 Feet = inches / 12 return Feet result = InchestoFeet(24) print(result) . 2 . If you look closely, there is a return at the end of the function, this returns a value when you call the function | This is why we have to set a variable, in this case result equal to the output of the function. | Also one thing to notice is that this function also takes in a parameter called inches | . Here&#39;s an example of calling functions in HTML with Javascript: . HI . . &lt;!-- function is called here --&gt; &lt;button id=&quot;enter&quot; onclick=&quot;print(a,b)&quot;&gt;HI&lt;/button&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- javascript --&gt; &lt;script&gt; function print(a,b) { document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;).innerHTML = a + b // math } // variables are defined var a = 1 var b = 2 &lt;/script&gt; . Hacks . Topic 3.12 (3.A): . Define procedure and parameter in your own words | Paste a screenshot of completion of the quiz | Define Return Values and Output Parameters in your own words | Code a procedure that finds the square root of any given number. (make sure to call and return the function) | Topic 3.13 (3.B): . Explain, in your own words, why abstracting away your program logic into separate, modular functions is effective | Create a procedure that uses other sub-procedures (other functions) within it and explain why the abstraction was needed (conciseness, shared behavior, etc.) | Add another layer of abstraction to the word counter program (HINT: create a function that can count the number of words starting with ANY character in a given string -- how can we leverage parameters for this?) | Topic 3.13 (3.C): .

            "content": "Unit 3.9 . 3.9.1 Algorithms (Claire) . A little review on Algorithms: . what are the three components of an algorithm? . sel__ | seq__ | it___ | . Today we will be looking at algorithms from another standpoint. . Main Idea 1: Algorithms can be written in different ways and still do the same thing . However, Algorithms that look similar might not always have the same result | Different algorithms can be used to solve the same problem | . Examples . The goal with the two algorithms below is to show &quot;Wow! Good job!&quot; when you get an A and show &quot;Nice!&quot; when you get a B or C (pass), if you don&#39;t pass (lower than 70) it will show &quot;Do Better&quot; . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) if 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? Wow! Good job! . Yay! it worked! Lets look at the next one. Do you notice any differences? Do you think this algorithm will still achieve the same goal? If not, what is the flaw? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif 70 &lt; grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . So, why is this important? Why are we even doing this? . When 2 algorithms look extremely similar, it is easy to assume they do the same thing. However, that is not the case and we have learn how to notice small differences in code and pretty much debug. . just know that codes that look similar don&#39;t always produce the same things :) | . Real-life situation (Storytime) . Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remeber that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) . Now, without running, investigate the algorithm below. This one looks different. Do you thing it will still achieve the same goal as above? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) A = grade &gt;= 90 B = 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90 C = grade &lt; 70 if A: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif B: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif C: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . Why is this important? . When collaborating or working on group projects, two people might come up with two different ways to solve a problem, and that happens a lot. . know that same goal can be achieved in many ways (the possibilities are endless) | make notes in you code! (explain how it works to others or you future self) | . How to write Nested Conditionals as Boolean expressions . the following 2 pieces of code is supposed to print &quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot; unless: . it is a weekday | . isHoliday = False isWeekday = True #if holiday, dont go to school if isHoliday == True: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school!&quot;) # otherwise, if it is a weekday, go to school else: if isWeekday == True: print(&quot;go to school!&quot;) # but if it is neither a weekday or holiday, don&#39;t go to school else: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot;) . isTuesday = False isThursday = False MonWedFri = True goPractice = not(isTuesday) and not(isThursday) and MonWedFri if goPractice == False: print(&quot;No pratice today!&quot;) if goPractice == True: print(&quot;Practice Today!&quot;) .

Hacks . why is it important to know that algorithms that look different can do the same thing and that algorithms that look the same might have different results?(0.15) | for the converted conditional to boolean conversion(0.10) | total: 0.25 | . 3.9.2 Developing Algorithms (Annika) . Developing Algorithms . When creating an algorithm, its good to outline its process before coding This ensures that it is sequenced correctly | . | You should represent the algorithm using a flowchart or natural language Visualization can help you better see the flow of the whole algorithm | This may allow for the coding process to be more efficient and effective | . | . Review of Selection and Iteration . Algorithms with iteration repeat a function until a goal is reached To more easily represent an algorithm without showing all the repeated steps, we can use iteration | . | Algorithms with selection only go through certain functions if certain things are true or false | . Example 1 . Start | The number of pretzels in the pack is 6 | Eat one pretzels, number of pretzels in pack goes down by 1 | How many pretzels are left? | Repeat step 3 until number of pretzels is 0 | Display that pack is empty | Finish | import random competitions = random.randint(0,5) rank = random.randint(1,30) if competitions &gt;= 2: if rank &lt;= 15: print(&quot;qualified&quot;) else: print(rank, &quot;not qualified&quot;) else: print(rank, &quot;ineligible&quot;) . 25 not qualified . Example 2 . The parking rate for a garage is as follows: Less than one hour: Free 1-2 hours: $5 &lt;br&gt; 2-3 hours: $8 3-4 hours: $10 &lt;br&gt; 4+ hours: $12 . . Start | Input number of hours parked | If hours is less than 1, cost is free | If hours is between 1 and 2, cost is $5 | If hours is between 2 and 3, cost is $8 | If hours is between 3 and 4, cost is $10 | If hours is more than 4, cost is $12 | Display cost and goodbye | Finish | print(&quot;The parking rate is as follows: n Less than one hour: Free n 1-2 hours: $5 n 2-3 hours: $8 n 3-4 hours: $10 n 4+ hours: $12&quot;) time = float(input(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;)) print(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;) print(time, &quot;hours costs:&quot;) if time &lt; 1 : print(&quot;Free&quot;) elif time &gt;= 1 and time &lt; 2 : print(&quot;$5&quot;) elif time &gt;= 2 and time &lt; 3 : print(&quot;$8&quot;) elif time &gt;= 3 and time &lt; 4 : print(&quot;$10&quot;) else: print(&quot;$12&quot;) print(&quot;Have a good day!&quot;) . Hacks . Develop your own complex algorithm using a flowchart and natural language, then code it! . Requirements: . Includes both a flowchart AND natural language | Working code of the same algorithm | Incorporates selection AND/OR iteration | Make it creative! | . Tips: . This site is good for making flowcharts! | Natural language should just be a list | Think about the whole process, not just the end result | . 3.9.3 Using preexisting algorithms (Grace) . Main Idea . Knowing existing algorithms can help construct new ones | simple existing algorithms can include determining min or max of two or more numbers | computing the sum or average | identifying if an integer is even or odd | . | Using existing correct algorithms can help as building blocks to reduce development time, testing, and identification of errors | . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from following the Collatz Conjecture. . Example: 6 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 . What does this function do? . if (n MOD 2 = 0) { display(&quot;n is even&quot;) } else { display(&quot;n is odd&quot;) } . By modifying the preexisting code, we can write create new code that follows th Collatz Conjecture. . DISPLAY (&quot;Choose a value for n&quot;) n &lt;- INPUT () REPEAT UNTIL (n = 1) { IF (n MOD 2 = 0 ) { n &lt;- n/2 } ELSE { n &lt;- n * 3 + 1 } . Hacks . Fix the number guessing game . Make a flow chart for the algorithm number guessing game | Make a function that gets the user guess | Modify the existing search function to give more encouraging feedback | import random #sets variables for the game num_guesses = 0 user_guess = 0 upper_bound = 100 lower_bound = 0 #generates a random number number = random.randint(1,100) # print(number) #for testing purposes print(&quot;I have chosen a number between 0 and 100.&quot;) print(&quot;Choose a number...&quot;) #Write a function that gets a guess from the user using input() def guess(): guessedNum = int(input(&quot;Guess a number&quot;)) return guessedNum #add something here #Change the print statements to give feedback on whether the player guessed too high or too low def search(number, guess): global lower_bound, upper_bound if guess &lt; number: print(&quot;You&#39;ve guessed wrong&quot;) elif guess &gt; number: print(&quot;TOO HIGH&quot;) return lower_bound, upper_bound while user_guess != number: user_guess = guess() num_guesses += 1 lower_bound, upper_bound = search(number, user_guess) print(f&quot;You guessed {user_guess}.&quot;) print(f&quot;Pick a number between {upper_bound} and {lower_bound}.&quot;) if guess() == number: break print(f&quot;You guessed the number in {num_guesses} guesses!&quot;) . I have chosen a number between 0 and 100. Choose a number... TOO HIGH You guessed 99. Pick a number between 100 and 0. You&#39;ve guessed wrong You guessed 80. Pick a number between 100 and 0.

In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables? . &lt;-- | . A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22? . 22 | . What is a list? | . A: Lists are sequences of elements where every element = a variable. . What is an element | . A: Elements are variables that are parts of lists. . What is an easy way to reference the elements in a list or string? | . A: An easy way to access elements is by putting the elements in an index and then using numbers to call specific parts of the string. . What is an example of a string? | . A: &quot;hello world&quot; . Data Abstraction . Lists bundle together multiple elements and/or variables under one name are not defined with specified lengths. | The variables that are stored in a list do not have to be limited to one kind of variable. | The user does not need to know how the list stores data (this gives way for data abstraction). | . How will this help with the AP Test? . The essential knowledge about variables within this lesson will help us to prepare for what we need to know during the college board test.

An algorithm is a finite set of instruction that accomplish a task, it can be expressed by natural language, diagrams, and various other ways. | . What are the three parts of an algorithm? . Sequencing, selection, and iteration. . | Every algorithm can be created by a mixture of sequencing, selection, and iteration . | . What is a sequence? . A sequence is the order of how to do something to achieve a result, similarly to how you follow the instructions from a teacher. | . What is a selection? . A selection allows an algorithm to make a decision based on if a condition is met, an example of this is when your car is out of fuel, you go to the gas station to fill your car, but if your car is full you wouldn&#39;t go to the gas station. | . What is a iteration? . An iteration is a loop and doing something again until a condition is met, like you put away your computer when you are finished with your work. | . How do we represent a step-by-step algorithmic process using sequential code statements? . First off what is a sequential code statement? Sequential statements are used in processes to specify how signals are assigned. The process is executed in order as a whole. After all the sequential statements in the process are executed the signals are assigned their new values. They execute in the order in which they appear in the process. | . | Sequencing - First step to do- Second step to do - third step to do Followed in the order that the code comes in. | You can put numerical values within variables. You can also put variable values inside other variables Ex. grade - 82 | Ex. highScore - currentScore | . | Can also store results of operations inside of a variable Ex. name - firstName + lastName | . | Can store results of a procedure call Average - calcAverage (10,20,30) | . | Order of operations very important Ex. grade1 - 10 | . | . | . How will this help with the AP Test and beyond? . Learning about algorithms and the three parts of them will allow us to apply it to questions about sequencing, selection and iteration. By learning these foundational parts of coding, we will be able to code our own programs and answer questions on the AP test. . Lydia&#39;s 3.3-3.4 Hacks .",

In the example, steps 1-5 are the sequence, and, for example, it cannot move on to step 2 until the first step is completed, which is setting the item to the number. . Selection: Selection is the conditional part of the algorithm where it makes the next decision whether or not the condition is true. In the example, if the number selected is equal to the item, “item found” would be displayed. . Iteration: Finally, iteration is the step where the program loops until the condition is met. Therefore, in the image, iteration would be when the program checks to see if there are more numbers in the list, going back to step 2. Then, if the condition is not met, it displays “item not found.” . Hack 2 . . 3 across - Sequence 1 down - Iteration 2 down - Selection . Hack 3 . .",

Iteration: a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | Before we dive deeper, we need to understand that an iteration is a part of an algorithm. And in that iteration is a set of instructions that need to be followed until a certain desired output is met. . Examples . Here is an example using online shopping: . . Lets say you are looking for a lost item inside of your house... What steps would you take? . Suppose there are n rooms to search... number the rooms 1-n . | Start by searching in room number 1 . | Search each room thoroughly for you item. . | Change the room number to the next highest number . | Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have found your lost item. . | Enjoy the lost item. . | WAIT! There is a flaw in the program. . This is where a stopping condition is useful for when the iteration already meets the desired requirement and gets out of the loop. . Programming Examples . l = 0 while (l &lt;= 3): print(&quot;Team Baddies 4 life&quot;) l = l + 2 . Team Baddies 4 life Team Baddies 4 life . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): #Try changing the 5 and see what happens! print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 if (i == 3): #Try Changing the 3 and see what happens! break . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . These are just a few examples of what you can do with iteration. . Summary: . An Iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | We can use stopping conditions to stop an iteration if a condition is already met | . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 - Parav Salaniwal . Lesson Objectives . Determine the result or side effect of iteration statements | Learn how to use iterations with for loops and while loops | Creating code to learn how to incrementally list numbers | Learn the range function and using variables in code | . Definition: Iteration Statement - cause statements to be executed zero or more times, subject to some loop-termination criteria . The first function we will learn is the range function, which we will use with for loop. As you may be able to guess, this will give us the sum based on the input provided. We always use a variable, such as i, to represent what the range of numbers the output will show. For example, if I wanted to list the numbers from 1-10 using the range function, it would look like this: . for i in range(10): print(i + 1) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Now the first thing you may notice is my input for the range was 11, and you may wonder why is it not 10? This is because when using the range function, the last number, or the ending value, is not included in the output, therefore we would have to add 1 to receive the correct output. Now if we were looking to include a starting value to have it start from 1 and end at 10, the code would look like this: . i = 1 for i in range(0,11): print(-i) . 0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10 . When using the range with for loop, the you can list much more than just a increment of one, would anyone like to guess how we could include a change in the incremented value? Try making a change in the python code above to change the incremented value. When using the range function: . for i in range(starting value, ending value, incremented value): print(i) . Now with while loops, we can provide a similar output with a variation in the input. Similar to for loops, it requires a variable which is the starting value. . i=3 while i&lt;=81: print(i) i=i+13 . 3 16 29 42 55 68 81 . Based on your knowledge from for loops, which values in the code above are the starting, incrementing, and ending values? . LESSON . . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 - Nikhil . Here is some basic code I have created, let&#39;s first look into this one: I created a list of pets, cat, dog, fish, and snake. Then I created a for loop, &quot;for i in pets&quot; and this looks at every element/value in pets, so &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;snake&quot;. This next if statmenets checks if the element in the list is &quot;fish&quot; and if it is, it breaks the loop. The statement would just print, cat and dog since the loop breaks at fish. . pets = [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;] for i in pets: if i == &quot;fish&quot;: break print(i) . cat dog . This while loop checks if number less than 10 is even and if so, it will print out the even numbers. We set a starting value of number = 0, then while the number is less than 10, the percent sign means modulus so meaning if there is a remaninder when we dvide. So if number divided by 2 has no remainder then it will print number. Then after that it will add 1 to the number and repeat the process untill it reaches 10. So let&#39;s check for 0, while 0 is less than ten, then it moves to next statement, since 0 divded by 2 has a remainder of 0 it will print the value of 0. Now it will add 1 to zero. Then it will see that 1 is less than ten, and then check if 1 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 which it does not, so it skips the print, and goes straight to addding one, so on so forth. . number = 0 while number &lt; 10: if number % 2 == 0: print(number) number += 1 . 0 2 4 6 8 . The purpose of this code is to find the sum of all the even numbers between and any number of your choosing. The integer input asks for the minimum and maximum value. The next statement puts a starting sum value set to 0. The for i in range (minimum,maximum+1) looks at every number between those two values, in this case 1 and 100. Then the if i modulus 2 checks if any numbers that are divisible by 2 and the remainder comes to 0. If there is a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, it adds that number to the sum. Then the last print statement, prints out the final sum of all even numbers between the two numbers of your choosing. . minimum = int(input(&quot;please enter a minimum number you want your range to be&quot;)) maximum = int(input(&quot;please enter a number that you want to be the maximum value&quot;)) sum = 0 for i in range(minimum,maximum+1): if i % 2 == 0: sum += i print(&quot;The sum of all the even numbers between&quot;, minimum, &quot;and&quot;, maximum, &quot;:&quot;, sum) . The sum of all the even numbers between 1 and 3 : 2 . LESSON . . HACKS Unit 3 Section 8 . Hacks Unit 3 Section 3.8.1 .

The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. . Hailstone numbers . The sequence of integers generated by Collatz conjecture are called Hailstone Numbers. Examples:Input : N = 7 Output : Hailstone Numbers: 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 No.&gt; ### Iteration The action or a process of iterating or repeating:such as. : a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result. . Undecidable problems . An undecidable problem is one that should give a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer, but yet no algorithm exists that can answer correctly on all inputs. . Unsolvable problems . An unsolvable problem is one for which no algorithm can ever be written to find the solution. . Additional information . A problem posed by L. Collatz in 1937, also called the 3x+1 mapping, 3n+1 problem, Hasse&#39;s algorithm, Kakutani&#39;s problem, Syracuse algorithm, Syracuse problem, Thwaites conjecture, and Ulam&#39;s problem (Lagarias 1985). Thwaites (1996) has offered a £1000 reward for resolving the conjecture. Let a_0 be an integer. Then one form of Collatz problem asks if iterating . always returns to 1 for positive a_0. (If negative numbers are included, there are four known cycles (excluding the trivial 0 cycle): (4, 2, 1), (-2, -1), (-5, -14, -7, -20, -10), and (-17, -50, -25, -74, -37, -110, -55, -164, -82, -41, -122, -61, -182, -91, -272, -136, -68, -34).) . The members of the sequence produced by the Collatz are sometimes known as hailstone numbers. Conway proved that the original Collatz problem has no nontrivial cycles of length &lt;400. Lagarias (1985) showed that there are no nontrivial cycles with length &lt;275000. Conway (1972) also proved that Collatz-type problems can be formally undecidable. Kurtz and Simon (2007) proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is undecidable; unfortunately, this proof cannot be applied to the original Collatz problem. . The Collatz algorithm has been tested and found to always reach 1 for all numbers &lt;=19·2^(58) approx 5.48×10^(18) (Oliveira e Silva 2008), improving the earlier results of 10^(15) (Vardi 1991, p. 129) and 5.6×10^(13) (Leavens and Vermeulen 1992). Because of the difficulty in solving this problem, Erdős commented that &quot;mathematics is not yet ready for such problems&quot; (Lagarias 1985). . The numbers of steps required for the algorithm to reach 1 for a_0=1, 2, ... are 0, 1, 7, 2, 5, 8, 16, 3, 19, 6, 14, 9, 9, 17, 17, 4, 12, 20, 20, 7, ... (OEIS A006577; illustrated above). Of these, the numbers of tripling steps are 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 5, 0, 6, ... (OEIS A006667), and the number of halving steps are 0, 1, 5, 2, 4, 6, 11, 3, 13, ... (OEIS A006666). The smallest starting values of a_0 that yields a Collatz sequence containing n=1, 2, ... are 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 7, 3, 9, 3, 7, 12, 7, 9, 15, 3, 7, 18, 19, ... (OEIS A070167). . The Collatz problem can be implemented as an 8-register machine (Wolfram 2002, p. 100), quasi-cellular automaton (Cloney et al. 1987, Bruschi 2005), or 6-color one-dimensional quasi-cellular automaton with local rules but which wraps first and last digits around (Zeleny). In general, the difficulty in constructing true local-rule cellular automata arises from the necessity of a carry operation when multiplying by 3 which, in the worst case, can extend the entire length of the base-b representation of digits (and thus require propagating information at faster than the CA&#39;s speed of light). .

For instance, If I wanted to create a sorting algorithm that sorts numbers the numbers [2,4,5,1,3]from least to greatest, rather than having an algorithm that compares itself to the next number and swaps accordingly it would be more efficient if you had a program that scans through all the numbers and checks whether a number is smaller or bigger than the rest than and sorts accordingly. Both of the algorithms had the same objective, but one runs more efficiently than the other. . Here is an example of an inefficient algorithm: . def inefficientWay(numbers): # Then it loops over the numbers for i in range(len(numbers)): # Now it finds the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j # Then it swaps the minimum number with the first unsorted number numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] # return the sorted list return numbers # test the algorithm print(inefficientWay([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) # should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - This algorithm is inefficent because it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. This is an inefficient way to sort a list. . Kush - Here is an efficent way to sort a list: . def efficient_sort(numbers): # loop over the numbers for i in range(len(numbers)): # find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j # swap the minimum number with the first unsorted number numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] # return the sorted list return numbers # test the algorithm print(efficient_sort([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) # should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - The difference in this algorithm is that it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. . How can you use algorithms to better your life: Mini activity . Yasha - Just for a second, think about all the tasks in your life that would work so much better automated. The sky&#39;s the limit. For an activity, write down or take a mental note of a task that you encounter in your day to day life, and think of ways where you can automate that task. An example of this would be me creating an algorithm for my morning routine. . tasks = [&quot;wake up&quot;, &quot;eat breakfast&quot;, &quot;brush teeth&quot;, &quot;go to school&quot;] def complete_tasks(tasks): for task in tasks: # code to complete each task goes here if task == &quot;wake up&quot;: print(&quot;Waking up now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;eat breakfast&quot;: print(&quot;Eating breakfast now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;go to school&quot;: print(&quot;Going to school now!&quot;) # and so on for each task in the list # call the function to complete the tasks complete_tasks(tasks) . Waking up now! Eating breakfast now! Going to school now! . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P1 . Kush - Sometimes when a problem has too many possibilities, a heuristic approach would be taken. let&#39;s use planes as an example. Imagine you were a musician on tour. You have shows in New Zealand, United States, Canada, and Russia. Well, what would be the shortest flight route so you can arrive at those destinations as fast as possible? You start in the United States. . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P2 . Kush - Well, since there are multiple possibilities, I chose to pick the countries closest to each other. The reason I chose this algorithm in particular is that it made the most sense. I had to start at United States, but then I went on to Canada, Russia, New Zealand, and then back to the United States. . Visual Representation . Hacks/assignment . Write 2 algorithms: One is efficent and one is innefficent, then explain why one is efficent while the other isn&#39;t. (.25) | Explain why one algorithm is more efficient than another using mathematical and/or formal reasoning. (.25) | use variables, if statements, and loops to program your algorithm and upload to jupyter notebooks/ fastpages. (.25) | .",

For example, the binary sequence 0101 represents the corresponding decimal value 5. Using this programming language, a programmer attempts to add the decimal values 14 and 15 and assign the sum to the variable total. Which of the following best describes the result of this operation? . For this question I put that “An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent either of the values 14 or 15.” However, I now know this was wrong as 14 and 15 can be represented in a 4 bit as 1110 and 1111. So, the correct answer would be “An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent 29, the sum of 14 and 15.” This is because the total, 29, is too big to be in a 4 bit. . Q36 . Consider the following code segment, which is intended to store ten consecutive even integers, beginning with 2, in the list evenList. Assume that evenList is initially empty. . i ← 1 . REPEAT 10 TIMES . { &lt; MISSING CODE &gt; } . Which of the following can be used to replace &lt; MISSING CODE &gt; so that the code segment works as intended? . I got this question wrong as I put i ← i + 1 APPEND(evenList, 2 * i) . This answer is wrong because the segment is not initialized to 0, which starts it at number 4. Therefore, below is the correct answer. . APPEND(evenList, 2 * i) i ← i + 1 . Q38 . Three words are stored in the variables word1, word2, and word3. The values of the variables are to be updated as shown in the following table. … Which of the following code segments can be used to update the values of the variables as shown in the table? . I chose answer b (temp ← word1 / word1 ← word3 / word3 ← temp), which was incorrect because the words were assigned to the wrong “word.” Answer b (temp ← word1 / word1 ← word3 / word3 ← temp), would be correct because word1 would become zebra, word2 would stay the same, and word3 would become xylophone. .",

Daily Video 1 . Learning Objectives: . Develop a program using a development process. | Design a program and its user interface. #### Essential Knowledge | A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature. | There ar emultiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: investigation and reglecting | designing | prototyping | testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process. | A development process that is incrememntal is one that breaks the problem in to smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole. | The design of a program incoroporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraits, as well as the concerns and interests of the people hwo will use the program. | Some ways investigation can be [erformed are as follows: collecting data through surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide. | A program&#39;s specification defines the requirements for the program. | In a development process, the dsign phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification. | The design phase of a program may include: brainstorming | planning and storyboarding | organizing the program into modules and funtional components | creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface | development of a testing strategy for the program #### How is a program developed? It starts with an idea. | . | Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind. | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan. | Sometimes the development is more exploratory tahn anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad). Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants. #### How is a program developed? Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect. | . | Investigation is an important step in the process. | Developers must: determine the requirements of the program | understand the constraints | understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? surverys | user testing | interviews | direct observations After initial investigation and reflection, | . | Developers design the program by brainstorming (draw on ingestigation) | storyboarding the program | planning user experience | laying out the user interface | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that describe how a program should behave | include a list of user interactions | . | The programs specifications outline all of the requirements. | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): an incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program Testing, testing, and more testing! | . | Developers test the program every step of the way. | Testing occurs at the micro level | macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection. ## Daily Video 2 #### Learning Objectives | Acknowledge code segments used from other sources. #### Essential Knowledge | It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source. | Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the origin or original author&#39;s name. #### How is aprogram developed? Program development is rarely a solo endeavor. | Programs are usually developed by teams of peoplle. | Individuals/teams work on different functional components. | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work. | Their names must e written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project. While documentation is an important place to give credit: | Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit. | This is an important part of the development of the program. | When developers find a bug (or an error in a program), they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem. | This may be most useful after program is completed, and users find additional bugs. Many times developers use code segments, procedures, alogrithms, and and more that are written by others. | These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited. | This is similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article. | Any code segments, procedures, algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author. | The program documentation should influde the author&#39;s name and the source of any code segments being used. | This portion of the documentaion may resemble a bibliography or a works cited page in a research paper. ## Daily Video 3 #### Lesson Objectives | Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation. #### Essential Knowledge | Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed. | Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs. | Programmers should document a program throughout its development. | Program documentation helps in developing and maintaininig correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. | Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be rquired. #### How is a program developed? Programmers create something called program documentation in order to: | describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe: functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program #### When does documentation happen? Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: | At the beginning: list of specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throught can improve: | efficiency of overall programming process | programmers&#39; ability to test and refine the program | programmers&#39; response to bugs #### How do programmers document while programming? Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. | Commenting allows programmers to write text within the program. | This text does not affect the program. | Comments are for programmers to read. | This is a form of ocumentation and can be very useful when programmers collaborate or work individually. | .",

Thus, we are getting and early start by using this Pair Share project as an iteration through the entire process, as that is the foundational principle behind PBL. . Teacher will help as directed by College Board… . Provide instruction, practice, and feedback related to content and skills that will help students succeed on the performance task. This can include, but needs not be limited to, the iterative development process, strategies for collaboration, the development of both data and procedural abstractions, and describing an algorithm’s purpose and explaining how it functions. | Brainstorm problems that programming can address or brainstorm special interests that students want to incorporate when developing a program. | Assist students in defining their focus and choice of topics without making selections for them (e.g., by asking questions). | Review the performance task directions and provide multiple opportunities to practice and discuss the entire performance task and individual prompts of the task. | Explain the role the teacher can and cannot play in providing students with assistance during the actual performance task; teachers should encourage students to take advantage of the opportunity to get assistance and feedback from teachers and peers during practice. | Review the scoring guidelines with students to help them understand how their work will be assessed. Teachers should remind students that the scoring guidelines align to the prompts in the performance task, so they must respond to all the prompts in their attempt to obtain the highest score possible. | . Disclaimer. Del Norte Computer Science Teachers are not experts in College Board scoring guidelines. It is best to look for examples of performance task submissions at high, medium, and low levels on College Board Web Site. Any grades you receive on any project in class may differ from scoring of the performance task by College Board. . General Requirements, from CB Exam Description . Prior to the official administration of the Create performance task, students need practice implementing programs that first include sequencing, then incorporate selection and iteration, and finally use procedures and lists. While collaboration on ideation and program design and development during the Create performance task is not required, it is encouraged. . You will be provided with a minimum of 12 hours of class time to complete and submit the following: . Final program code (created independently or collaboratively) | A video that displays the running of your program and demonstrates functionality you developed (created independently) | Written responses to all the prompts in the performance task (created independently) | .

Collaboration happens when two or more students are actively engaged in the development of a program. Some examples of acceptable ways to collaborate are as follows. . 2 students who are writing the entire program together, perhaps using pair programming. | 2 or more students who have divided a larger, more complex program into different separate parts, each writing their own part and then assembling the pieces into the finished program. | Student(s) giving feedback on an independently or collaboratively written program. | Student(s) providing debugging assistance to another student or collaborative group of students. | . Del Norte Computer Science Principles Teachers want to see all of these prescribe methods of collaboration utilized. . Collaboration without Plagiarism, from CB Q&amp;A . If students are combining independently written program code with another student, they should cite that the program code is written by a collaborative peer. To protect the anonymity of the collaborative peer, students simply state that the portion of program code was written by their collaborative peer, rather than putting the names of themselves or their collaborative peer in the program code. . When completing the Create performance task, students will need to add substantial revisions and additional functionality when starting with preexisting program code. Simply changing an image in a game or the names of variables is insufficient. . Del Norte Computer Science Principles Teachers have zero tolerance for plagiarism. Misrepresenting your own work and not attending class (without makeup) are the only ways to get less than 70% in the class. Plagiarism is 0%, being in class is 50%, any individual effort with attendance gets 70%. The biggest jeopardy to getting a bad grade in the class is getting a 0%, the only possibility of such is plagiarism or missing class without makeup. .

GTA Online vehicles are expensive things, so we&#39;re happy to take a spin on the Diamond Casino&#39;s Lucky Wheel to get a discount. Winning isn&#39;t guaranteed, sure, but it isn&#39;t out of the question either. Look, we don&#39;t have a problem - leave it alone. Finding out what the GTA Online podium car is simple enough - it&#39;s winning it that&#39;s the challenge. You can spin the Diamond Casino&#39;s Lucky Wheel once a day, and each Podium Car refreshes after seven days on a Thursday. Basically, you have seven shots to get the vehicle of that given week. If you own a Penthouse, you can spin it for free, but if you don&#39;t it&#39;s $500 a spin. Don&#39;t fret if you don&#39;t win, as you can try for something else. You have a one in 20 chance of getting the podium vehicle, a car discount, or a mystery prize. There&#39;s a four in 20 chance of getting clothes, chips, and cash. Finally, there&#39;s a five in 20 chance of getting RP.

Daily Video 1 . Learning Objectives: . Develop a program using a development process. | Design a program and its user interface. #### Essential Knowledge | A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature. | There ar emultiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: investigation and reglecting | designing | prototyping | testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process. | A development process that is incrememntal is one that breaks the problem in to smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole. | The design of a program incoroporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraits, as well as the concerns and interests of the people hwo will use the program. | Some ways investigation can be [erformed are as follows: collecting data through surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide. | A program&#39;s specification defines the requirements for the program. | In a development process, the dsign phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification. | The design phase of a program may include: brainstorming | planning and storyboarding | organizing the program into modules and funtional components | creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface | development of a testing strategy for the program #### How is a program developed? It starts with an idea. | . | Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind. | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan. | Sometimes the development is more exploratory tahn anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad). Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants. #### How is a program developed? Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect. | . | Investigation is an important step in the process. | Developers must: determine the requirements of the program | understand the constraints | understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? surverys | user testing | interviews | direct observations After initial investigation and reflection, | . | Developers design the program by brainstorming (draw on ingestigation) | storyboarding the program | planning user experience | laying out the user interface | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that describe how a program should behave | include a list of user interactions | . | The programs specifications outline all of the requirements. | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): an incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program Testing, testing, and more testing! | . | Developers test the program every step of the way. | Testing occurs at the micro level | macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection. ## Daily Video 2 #### Learning Objectives | Acknowledge code segments used from other sources. #### Essential Knowledge | It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source. | Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the origin or original author&#39;s name. #### How is aprogram developed? Program development is rarely a solo endeavor. | Programs are usually developed by teams of peoplle. | Individuals/teams work on different functional components. | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work. | Their names must e written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project. While documentation is an important place to give credit: | Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit. | This is an important part of the development of the program. | When developers find a bug (or an error in a program), they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem. | This may be most useful after program is completed, and users find additional bugs. Many times developers use code segments, procedures, alogrithms, and and more that are written by others. | These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited. | This is similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article. | Any code segments, procedures, algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author. | The program documentation should influde the author&#39;s name and the source of any code segments being used. | This portion of the documentaion may resemble a bibliography or a works cited page in a research paper. ## Daily Video 3 #### Lesson Objectives | Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation. #### Essential Knowledge | Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed. | Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs. | Programmers should document a program throughout its development. | Program documentation helps in developing and maintaininig correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. | Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be rquired. #### How is a program developed? Programmers create something called program documentation in order to: | describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe: functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program #### When does documentation happen? Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: | At the beginning: list of specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throught can improve: | efficiency of overall programming process | programmers&#39; ability to test and refine the program | programmers&#39; response to bugs #### How do programmers document while programming? Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. | Commenting allows programmers to write text within the program. | This text does not affect the program. | Comments are for programmers to read. | This is a form of ocumentation and can be very useful when programmers collaborate or work individually. | .",
