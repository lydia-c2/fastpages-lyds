Daily Video 1 . Learning Objectives: . Develop a program using a development process. | Design a program and its user interface. #### Essential Knowledge | A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature. | There ar emultiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: investigation and reglecting | designing | prototyping | testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process. | A development process that is incrememntal is one that breaks the problem in to smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole. | The design of a program incoroporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraits, as well as the concerns and interests of the people hwo will use the program. | Some ways investigation can be [erformed are as follows: collecting data through surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide. | A program&#39;s specification defines the requirements for the program. | In a development process, the dsign phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification. | The design phase of a program may include: brainstorming | planning and storyboarding | organizing the program into modules and funtional components | creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface | development of a testing strategy for the program #### How is a program developed? It starts with an idea. | . | Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind. | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan. | Sometimes the development is more exploratory tahn anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad). Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants. #### How is a program developed? Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect. | . | Investigation is an important step in the process. | Developers must: determine the requirements of the program | understand the constraints | understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? surverys | user testing | interviews | direct observations After initial investigation and reflection, | . | Developers design the program by brainstorming (draw on ingestigation) | storyboarding the program | planning user experience | laying out the user interface | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that describe how a program should behave | include a list of user interactions | . | The programs specifications outline all of the requirements. | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): an incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program Testing, testing, and more testing! | . | Developers test the program every step of the way. | Testing occurs at the micro level | macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection. ## Daily Video 2 #### Learning Objectives | Acknowledge code segments used from other sources. #### Essential Knowledge | It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source. | Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the origin or original author&#39;s name. #### How is aprogram developed? Program development is rarely a solo endeavor. | Programs are usually developed by teams of peoplle. | Individuals/teams work on different functional components. | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work. | Their names must e written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project. While documentation is an important place to give credit: | Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit. | This is an important part of the development of the program. | When developers find a bug (or an error in a program), they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem. | This may be most useful after program is completed, and users find additional bugs. Many times developers use code segments, procedures, alogrithms, and and more that are written by others. | These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited. | This is similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article. | Any code segments, procedures, algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author. | The program documentation should influde the author&#39;s name and the source of any code segments being used. | This portion of the documentaion may resemble a bibliography or a works cited page in a research paper. ## Daily Video 3 #### Lesson Objectives | Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation. #### Essential Knowledge | Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed. | Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs. | Programmers should document a program throughout its development. | Program documentation helps in developing and maintaininig correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. | Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be rquired. #### How is a program developed? Programmers create something called program documentation in order to: | describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe: functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program #### When does documentation happen? Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: | At the beginning: list of specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throught can improve: | efficiency of overall programming process | programmers&#39; ability to test and refine the program | programmers&#39; response to bugs #### How do programmers document while programming? Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. | Commenting allows programmers to write text within the program. | This text does not affect the program. | Comments are for programmers to read. | This is a form of ocumentation and can be very useful when programmers collaborate or work individually. | .",

            "content": "Learning Create Performance Task, 30% of grade on AP exam . Each time we engage in Code/Code/Coding it is an opportunity to think of the possibility of fulfilling the Create Performance Task requirement. But, this is a student project and responsibility is on you. To be thinking and preparing is a mindset, one that Del Norte CompSci Teachers advise as we proceed through topics. Thus, we are getting and early start by using this Pair Share project as an iteration through the entire process, as that is the foundational principle behind PBL. . Teacher will help as directed by College Board… . Provide instruction, practice, and feedback related to content and skills that will help students succeed on the performance task. This can include, but needs not be limited to, the iterative development process, strategies for collaboration, the development of both data and procedural abstractions, and describing an algorithm’s purpose and explaining how it functions. | Brainstorm problems that programming can address or brainstorm special interests that students want to incorporate when developing a program. | Assist students in defining their focus and choice of topics without making selections for them (e.g., by asking questions). | Review the performance task directions and provide multiple opportunities to practice and discuss the entire performance task and individual prompts of the task. | Explain the role the teacher can and cannot play in providing students with assistance during the actual performance task; teachers should encourage students to take advantage of the opportunity to get assistance and feedback from teachers and peers during practice. | Review the scoring guidelines with students to help them understand how their work will be assessed. Teachers should remind students that the scoring guidelines align to the prompts in the performance task, so they must respond to all the prompts in their attempt to obtain the highest score possible. | . Disclaimer. Del Norte Computer Science Teachers are not experts in College Board scoring guidelines. It is best to look for examples of performance task submissions at high, medium, and low levels on College Board Web Site. Any grades you receive on any project in class may differ from scoring of the performance task by College Board. . General Requirements, from CB Exam Description . Prior to the official administration of the Create performance task, students need practice implementing programs that first include sequencing, then incorporate selection and iteration, and finally use procedures and lists. While collaboration on ideation and program design and development during the Create performance task is not required, it is encouraged. . You will be provided with a minimum of 12 hours of class time to complete and submit the following: . Final program code (created independently or collaboratively) | A video that displays the running of your program and demonstrates functionality you developed (created independently) | Written responses to all the prompts in the performance task (created independently) | . Del Norte Computer Science Principles Teachers are requiring students to do collaborative ideation, program design, prototyping and pair programming on these early activities that we grade in class. . Create Performance Task Skills and Rubric Breakdown (Out of 6 Points) . Note: There is no partial credit (0 or 1 point for each section). AP Computer Science Principles Exam is a through-course performance task that assesses Computational Thinking Practices 1, 2, 3, and 4 across six rubric rows. . Snake Game . Site Template . Row 1: Program Purpose and Function . Assesses students’ ability to explain how a code segment or program functions. (Skill: Code Analysis) | For 3a, make sure to differentiate between program purpose and function They are defined in the scoring guidelines | . | . Row 2: Data Abstraction . Assesses students’ ability to use abstraction to manage complexity in a program. (Skill Abstraction in Program Development - data) | . Row 3: Managing Complexity . Assesses students’ ability to explain how abstraction manages complexity. (Skill Abstraction in Program Development explain complexity) | Be specific about how the program manages complexity in the context of your own program | . Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . Assesses students’ ability to use abstraction to manage complexity in a program. (Skill Abstraction in Program Development - procedures/functions) | Must be a student-developed procedure | . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . Assesses students’ ability to implement and apply an algorithm. (Skill Algorithms and Program Development) | . Row 6: Testing . Assesses students’ ability to investigate the situation, context,or task. (Skill Computational Solution Design - testing) | . Collaboration Rules, from CB Q&amp;A . Collaboration happens when two or more students are actively engaged in the development of a program. Some examples of acceptable ways to collaborate are as follows. . 2 students who are writing the entire program together, perhaps using pair programming. | 2 or more students who have divided a larger, more complex program into different separate parts, each writing their own part and then assembling the pieces into the finished program. | Student(s) giving feedback on an independently or collaboratively written program. | Student(s) providing debugging assistance to another student or collaborative group of students. | . Del Norte Computer Science Principles Teachers want to see all of these prescribe methods of collaboration utilized. . Collaboration without Plagiarism, from CB Q&amp;A . If students are combining independently written program code with another student, they should cite that the program code is written by a collaborative peer. To protect the anonymity of the collaborative peer, students simply state that the portion of program code was written by their collaborative peer, rather than putting the names of themselves or their collaborative peer in the program code. . When completing the Create performance task, students will need to add substantial revisions and additional functionality when starting with preexisting program code. Simply changing an image in a game or the names of variables is insufficient. . Del Norte Computer Science Principles Teachers have zero tolerance for plagiarism. Misrepresenting your own work and not attending class (without makeup) are the only ways to get less than 70% in the class. Plagiarism is 0%, being in class is 50%, any individual effort with attendance gets 70%. The biggest jeopardy to getting a bad grade in the class is getting a 0%, the only possibility of such is plagiarism or missing class without makeup. .
