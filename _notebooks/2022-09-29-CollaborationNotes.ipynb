    "## Daily Video 1\n",
    "#### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "- Develop a program using a development process.\n",
    "- Design a program and its user interface.\n",
    "#### Essential Knowledge\n",
    "- A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature.\n",
    "- There ar emultiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program:\n",
    "    - investigation and reglecting\n",
    "    - designing\n",
    "    - prototyping\n",
    "    - testing\n",
    "- A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process.\n",
    "- A development process that is incrememntal is one that breaks the problem in to smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole.\n",
    "- The design of a program incoroporates investigation to determine its requirements.\n",
    "- Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraits, as well as the concerns and interests of the people hwo will use the program.\n",
    "- Some ways investigation can be [erformed are as follows:\n",
    "    - collecting data through surveys\n",
    "    - user testing\n",
    "    - interviews\n",
    "    - direct observations\n",
    "- Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide.\n",
    "- A program's specification defines the requirements for the program.\n",
    "- In a development process, the dsign phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification.\n",
    "- The design phase of a program may include:\n",
    "    - brainstorming\n",
    "    - planning and storyboarding\n",
    "    - organizing the program into modules and funtional components\n",
    "    - creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface\n",
    "    - development of a testing strategy for the program\n",
    "#### How is a program developed?\n",
    "It starts with an idea.\n",
    "- Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind.\n",
    "- Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan.\n",
    "- Sometimes the development is more exploratory tahn anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad).\n",
    "    - Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants.\n",
    "#### How is a program developed?\n",
    "Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect.\n",
    "- Investigation is an important step in the process.\n",
    "- Developers must:\n",
    "    - determine the requirements of the program\n",
    "    - understand the constraints\n",
    "    - understand the user concerns and interests\n",
    "- How do developers investigate?\n",
    "    - surverys\n",
    "    - user testing\n",
    "    - interviews\n",
    "    - direct observations\n",
    "After initial investigation and reflection,\n",
    "- Developers design the program by\n",
    "    - brainstorming (draw on ingestigation)\n",
    "    - storyboarding the program\n",
    "    - planning user experience\n",
    "    - laying out the user interface\n",
    "    - organizing into modules\n",
    "    - develop a testing strategy\n",
    "- Developers decide on the program requirements that\n",
    "    - describe how a program should behave\n",
    "    - include a list of user interactions\n",
    "- The programs specifications outline all of the requirements.\n",
    "- Developers create a prototype of the program (or components):\n",
    "    - an incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program\n",
    "Testing, testing, and more testing!\n",
    "- Developers test the program every step of the way.\n",
    "- Testing occurs at the\n",
    "    - micro level\n",
    "    - macro level\n",
    "- Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection.\n",
    "## Daily Video 2\n",
    "#### Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Acknowledge code segments used from other sources.\n",
    "#### Essential Knowledge\n",
    "- It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source.\n",
    "- Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the origin or original author's name.\n",
    "#### How is aprogram developed?\n",
    "Program development is rarely a solo endeavor.\n",
    "- Programs are usually developed by teams of peoplle.\n",
    "- Individuals/teams work on different functional components.\n",
    "- Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work.\n",
    "- Their names must e written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project.\n",
    "While documentation is an important place to give credit:\n",
    "- Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit.\n",
    "- This is an important part of the development of the program.\n",
    "- When developers find a bug (or an error in a program), they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem.\n",
    "- This may be most useful after program is completed, and users find additional bugs.\n",
    "Many times developers use code segments, procedures, alogrithms, and and more that are written by others.\n",
    "- These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited.\n",
    "- This is similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article.\n",
    "- Any code segments, procedures, algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author.\n",
    "- The program documentation should influde the author's name and the source of any code segments being used.\n",
    "- This portion of the documentaion may resemble a bibliography or a works cited page in a research paper.\n",
    "## Daily Video 3\n",
    "#### Lesson Objectives\n",
    "- Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation.\n",
    "#### Essential Knowledge\n",
    "- Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed.\n",
    "- Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs.\n",
    "- Programmers should document a program throughout its development.\n",
    "- Program documentation helps in developing and maintaininig correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments.\n",
    "- Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be rquired.\n",
    "#### How is a program developed?\n",
    "Programmers create something called program documentation in order to:\n",
    "- describe the overall program\n",
    "- list program specifications\n",
    "- describe:\n",
    "    - functions/procedures/methods within the code\n",
    "    - specific code segments\n",
    "    - list of events and corresponding outputs\n",
    "    - the development of the program\n",
    "    - how other programs may interact with the program\n",
    "- list of contributors/authors of the program\n",
    "#### When does documentation happen?\n",
    "Documentation happens throughout the development of the program:\n",
    "- At the beginning: list of specifications\n",
    "- During: to keep track of process\n",
    "- After: to explain the overall process\n",
    "Documentation throught can improve:\n",
    "- efficiency of overall programming process\n",
    "- programmers' ability to test and refine the program\n",
    "- programmers' response to bugs\n",
    "#### How do programmers document while programming?\n",
    "Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not.\n",
    "- Commenting allows programmers to write text within the program.\n",
    "- This text does not affect the program.\n",
    "- Comments are for programmers to read.\n",
    "- This is a form of ocumentation and can be very useful when programmers collaborate or work individually.\n",
