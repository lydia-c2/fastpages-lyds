    "\n",
    "#### Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements:\n",
    "If, Elif, and Else conditionals allow the procedure to check whether the conditions are true, and if so, to execute the code. Else is what code is run when none of the if or elif statements are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/FlowCode2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python For, While loops with Range, with List: \n",
    "For and while loops allow for a code to repeat without having to type out the code multiple times.\n",
    "- While loops allow a procedure to repeat while the statement is true.\n",
    "- For loops using lists allow you to pull variables from within the lists or whatever has been appended into the list\n",
    "\n",
    "![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/FlowCode1.png)\n",
