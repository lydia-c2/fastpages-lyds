I visited and learned about many projects (not all pictured) and it was so cool to see all the different ideas. I also saw a site, called DN Marketplace that allowed me ot sell whatever I wanted (pictured below).\n",

Plus, in studio art, we learned about the prompt behind their art pieces which was really cool. \n",
